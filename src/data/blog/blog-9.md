        </div>
        <div class="col-2 offset-1">
            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Users nowadays are used to scrolling down the pages to grab every piece of content. Design and content play a significant role in encouraging users to scroll till the end of the page. It increases the session duration, which is suitable for search engine optimization (SEO). So, there are several benefits of having a parallax scrolling experience on the website.</p>
                <p>For those who are unaware of this technique, it is a special scrolling experience on web pages where the background images on a page scroll slower than the foreground content. It adds an in-depth experience like a 3-D site, even when the site is two-dimensional.</p>

            <h2>Thumb-Friendly Navigation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 offset-1">
            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Mobile-first experience is not a new term. It has been here for the last few years. It is essential to have a mobile-friendly website as most of the users browse using smartphones today. To further improve the user experience on mobile devices, the new best web design trend is thumb-friendly navigation. </p>
                <p>When people browse on mobile phones, their fingers wrap around the back of the phone and the thumb takes ownership. This is the habit of the majority of users to scroll and navigate on a website with the thumb.</p>
                <p>Hence, thumb-friendly navigation makes sense to improve the way users navigate.</p>
                <p>In such a design, the thumb of the user easily reaches the menu bar, buttons, and elements on the site. Companies that provide WordPress development services also work on creating thumb-friendly website themes today.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-2 offset-1">
            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Audacity and the unique attire to every frame of the design are what people loved in 2022. Blurring at the small part or to the skewed one is always contagious and unique for the designs. Designers have experimented with different intensities to accomplish what is best to showcase on the platform. Add a layer of composition and blend it with the effect of blurriness which makes the design completely different.</p>
                <p>This crisp texture highlights only the important part, and keeps the other elements vague.</p>

            <h2>Minimalist Design</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 offset-1">
            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Minimalism is all about offering more in less, by having a clean, simple, and uncluttered web design. Also called flat design, minimalist design is one of the top trends in website design.</p>
                <p>Apple’s website is a fine example of minimalism. It has a lot of white space, bringing the focus of the user to the main content. This year, the number of websites experimenting with minimalist design is significantly growing. Also, it is not necessary to have white space to create a minimalist design. Shopify is another example of minimalism that uses shades of dark green as background color and uses a minimal design with clean text.</p>

        <div class="col-2 offset-1">
            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Human psychology has penned down their interest in the designs which have a subtle alignment of content within the lines. In 2022, designers are more into real designs and experiences for the users. Boundaries, formats, borders, grids; are the transient foundation for any website.</p>
                <p>A clear boundary is visible and idealistic for the user to scan different sections. These 90s designs throwback the retro and vintage look into the frame making it more classy than before. Such designs are much more focused and convenient for designers to explain their story under boundaries.</p>

        <div class="col-2 offset-1">

                <p>In 2022, the implementation of VR on websites is increasing all the more as the technology is becoming more accessible and mainstream. For example, the leading furniture business IKEA shows its customers how the sofas, beds, and other furniture will look in their rooms or homes. It significantly drives more users to consider the purchase.</p>

            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Micro-interactions are the tiny bits of animations on a website or app that create motion when users interact with them. You might be aware of the link hovers and color changes.

            <div class="rn-blog-content">

            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Plenty of users today prefer dark design because it reduces eye strain. This makes sense as the average number of hours per day spent on screens has increased.</p>

            <div class="rn-blog-content">
                <p>Motion is responsible for defining an unique element in designing but sometimes it gets confusing and harmful to the user. For people with motion sickness, it becomes worse for them with the continued animations, parallax effects, mouse hover, and high brightness. Designers have a responsibility to consider such harm while they build designs.</p>
                <p>To handle that case, designers have used CSS media queries for the reduced preferred motions.</p>

                <p>You might have already heard about the importance of voice search optimization. As people nowadays choose to search with voice commands using devices like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, it makes sense to have a voice user interface on the website.</p>
